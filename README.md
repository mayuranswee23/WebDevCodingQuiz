##WebDevCodingQuiz

##In this project, we are tasked to create a quiz using the fundamentals of javascript and the DOM. Initally, a start button will appear on the page with a description above that states the function of the quiz. Additionally, there is a high score button below the start button to view the previous high scores. When the start button is clicked, the first question appears on the screen. The timer starts a countdown from 20sec, and every wrong answer deducts the time by 10 sec. After the quiz is complete, an alert will show the score, which is the remaining time of the timer.
